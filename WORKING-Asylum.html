  <strong> BURLINGTON, NC— </strong>Two years ago, Carlos found his 16-year-old son beaten, barefoot and with a knife wound in his stomach. His son had been targeted and kidnapped by the gang MS-13. 
<br>
<br> 
According to the Human Rights Watch, approximately 60,000 gang members are present in at least 246 of the country's 262 municipalities. El Salvador also has one of the world's highest homocide rates. According to data from the United Nations, the country reports having 50 homocides per every 100,000 residents.

<br>
To this day, Carlos still wonders why MS-13 targetted his son. He thinks maybe it's because his son looked mature for his age and the gang wanted to recruit him.
<br>
<br>    
After his son's kidnapping, he lived two more years in their home village in El Salvador. But the gang had already targetted him, and life was too dangerous. Carlos said his son was unable to go to school, work or even relocate to another country. Anywhere that MS-13 was active, his son was not safe.

<br>  
When his son was 18 years old, Carlos decided to leave El Salvador and immigrate to the U.S. Carlos left quickly in the night, leaving his wife and young daughters behind. 
<br> 
<br>
Carlos and his son crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in an opening in the wall, waving their hands in the air to signal a surrender. They both were detained by U.S. Departent of Homeland Security officers, and began the process of applying for asylum at a detention center in Texas.

<br>
Applying for aslyum is a long process, but it starts with an initial interview. In the interview, an immigrant  must prove they are in fear of their lives and that the U.S. is their only option for safety. If the immigrant is not in fear for their life, they will apply to for other kinds of immigration status to enter the country, like through a visa. 
<br> 
<br>
The interview to determine if someone meets the requirements for asylum in the U.S. is a fear detection interview or a credible fear interview. According to asylum attorneys, passing the interview is a critical part of claiming asylum in the U.S. Not passing the interview means being sent home. 
<br> 
<br> 
After three days of detention, Carlos and his son passed the interview and were released. They came to Alamance County to stay with a relative and continue the asylum application process. Carlos and his son are now working at a construction company with their relative. 

<br> 
<br> 
Just down the street from Carlos’ new home, fear detection interviews are taking place at the Alamance County Detention Center. <br> 
<h2> Asylum Interviews in Alamance County</h2>
<br>
<p>
Starting in January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement — a law enforcement agency under Homeland Security — began using the Alamance County Detention Center to detain asylum-seekers and interview them for asylum.  
<br>
<br>
According to ICE's records, the relationship Alamance County has with ICE is unique. There is no report of any other facility in North Carolina that has an asylum-program like Alamance. 
<br>
<br>
The Alamance County Detention Center has a historically good relationship with ICE. For six years, it upheld a partnership called 287(g), where the sheriff’s department would file anyone arrested in an ICE database. It also has historically allowed ICE to use its facility before. 
<br>
<br>
For this fiscal year, Alamance County Board of Commissioners <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlJR-gOBVh0&list=PL3YFYzGM_pvEMirRoLKG3V0ZsXAmxgRFp&index=3">approved an over $2.3 million contract</a> with ICE. The contract gives ICE the ability to detain inmates in the Alamance County jail and conduct fear-detection interviews. Currently, ICE is paying Alamance County $135 per inmate per day. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
Byron Tucker, communications director of Alamance County Sheriff's Department, said that ICE has “their own area of the detention center,” and provides their own bed space. Tucker said the sheriff’s office has little involvement in the work ICE is doing in the Alamance detention center. 
<br>
<br>
Those who are in detention at Alamance County come straight from the border, according to local immigration lawyers.
<h2> Local advocates respond</h2>
<p>
In response to asylum-seekers coming to Alamance County, a local advocacy group FronteraTech established a relationship with ICE to help asylum-seekers pass their fear detection interviews. The firm is partnering with Duke University school this semester to train students to counsel those in Alamance County. 
<br>
<br>
The program, which began in September, is composed of mostly graduate students and professors. So far, over 80 percent of the asylum-seekers have passed their interviews. Kate Evans, clinical professor of law, said she hopes to have a clinic with students, professors and volunteers operating in the jail by next year. 
<br>
<br>
Damajan Denoble, executive director of FronteraTech, said it is unclear why ICE is using the Alamance County detention center to conduct fear detection interviews. But his organization sees it as an opportunity. 
<br>
<br>
“What we have permission to do essentially is to go in, do legal orientation and we’ve been able to identify people with certain problems we’ve been able to solve within the clinic,” Denoble said. 
<br>

<p>
Denoble said the job of his organization is to “apply pressure” to jails with partnerships with ICE by sending in volunteers, students and offering free legal representation. 
<br>
<br>
Previously, FronteraTech worked in Charleston, South Carolina, at the Al Cannon detention center for four and a half months at the beginning of 2019. The jail had the same partnership with ICE,<a href="https://www.live5news.com/2019/03/28/ccso-holding-off-taking-more-ice-detainees-amid-dozens-deputy-vacancies/"> but eventually ended its asylum-program. </a> Denoble said there were over 60 volunteers working with the jail. 
<br> 
<br>
Doo Hyun Nam, Director of Volutneer events at Duke University, has visited the Alamance county detention center every Friday. 
    
<br>
<br>
“The project is one of the most rewarding work I have ever done," Nam said. "Entering the jail and working with the detainees, in a space smaller than a school cafeteria, on an issue of life or death, is truly surreal.”
<br> 
<br>
Natalie Pate, Duke University law student working with the inaugural clinic, said that the students are often the first friendly faces the immigrants will see in a new country. 
<br>
<br>
"One of the first things we tell them, is we show them a map of the U.S. and we are like, you are here in North Carolina," said Pate. 
<br>
<br>

<p> 
Most of the aslyum seekers that Pate has talked to are unaware of what state or detention center they've been in or where they are headed next. 
<br>
<br> 
"They are being shipped across like cargo," Pate said. 
<br>
<br>
Pate and other students at Duke are able to counsel with the aslyum-seekers in their native language and coach them through their fear detection interviews. 
<br>
<br>
<h2> Next Steps</h2>
<p> 
Passing the fear detection interview is just one part of the process. After passing an interview, aslyum-seekers will look for a way to post bail. If they find the funds, they will be released from detention to continue the aslyum process, according to local lawyers. Lawyers working in Alamance said most asylum-seekers who are relreased from Alamance County detention will have their cases heard in immigration courts in Charlotte, Dallas or Arlington. 
<br> 
<br>
Advocacy groups such as FronteraTech will sometimes offer free representation to asylum-seekers. Lawyers who are passionate about asylum, like Denoble, will take on pro-bono cases. But most who are applying for asylum are not represented, <a href = "https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/562/"> according to research from Syracuse University.</a> Carlos said he does not have a lawyer for his case and does not have the funds to get one in the future.  
<br>
<br>
Unlike in civil or criminal court, asylum-seekers do not have the right to any legal representation. The chances of being granted asylum often depends on which circuit an asylum applicant is placed in, according to research from Syracus University. 
<br><br>
Carlos has a pending asylum case in Charlotte. In 2018, over 90 percent of immigration cases in the Charlotte circuit were denied, which is five percent higher than rate at which cases are denied nationally <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/539/">according to Syracuse University.</a> 
<br><br>
Carlos' home country, El Salvador, is frequently viewed as a high-crime and dangerous country. In April, the U.S. <a href="https://www.osac.gov/Country/ElSalvador/Content/Detail/Report/d1222be6-4e5d-461f-912c-15f4aec90b02">issued a Level 3 travel advisory for the country,</a> advising no one to travel to major cities because of how many crimes had been reported. Specfically the U.S. was warning about assault, homocide, rape and sexual assault. 
<br>
<br>
Despite recognition of these high levels of crime, El Salvadorians still have a low rate of being approved asylum. In the Charlotte circuit only 8 percent of El Salvadorians were granted asylum.

<br>

<p> The federal government has recently made it significantly harder to apply for asylum if you are fleeing gang violence. Last summer, <a href ="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/us/politics/sessions-domestic-violence-asylum.html">U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned a precedent </a>made in the Obama Administration that gang violence was grounds for approving asylum cases, decreasing someone like Carlos’ chances of claiming asylum.
<br>
<br>
Carlos still holds out hope for a better life in the U.S. 
<br>
<br>
“Here, I think you can have a better opportunity,” he said. “I’m not asking to be maintained but at least to be able to be here.”
